<h1>Carey Newspaper: Save The Pandas</h1>
  <center>Pandas have been killed by human activity for a very long time. We should help them because we were the ones who put them in the situation they currently are in. They are in this situation for many reasons. Some of these reasons are deforestation, poaching and climate change.
<br><br>
We should also help the pandas because they are a cute animal many people in the world love. They are also a symbol to many religions. If we protect many of the religions that depend on the symbol of the pandas can thrive.
<br><br>
We know that they can recover if we help them, because in many places of the world such grasslands and oceans we have recovered endangered animals and environments. Many people are already working to save the pandas. China has created many reservations for the pandas.
